Feel free to send me Pull Requests with your Keyboard Maestro macros.  
*Please* put the macros in a group named "Keyboard Maestro Macros Repo" first, *before* exporting. When someone downloads/clones this repo and double-clicks a macro, they will be added to that group. This will help to keep this repo more consistent.

If there are numerous macros you want to contribute, then make a separate group, e.g. "Special Characters" in this repository.
