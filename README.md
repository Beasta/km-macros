My favorite Keyboard Maestro macros. I anticipate having some descriptive text here for the macros. Until then, please have a look at the commit messages!

### Clipboard ###

* Append Selection to Clipboard: Puts selected text on clipboard (⌘C) and appends it to the previous entry.* Manipulate Clipboard: Displays the clipboard contents in a text field for manipulation. Saves changes back to clipboard.

### Finder ###

* Symbolic Link: Shows Create symbolic links using Keyboard Maestro. 

### General Use ###

* Switch back to frontmost app: I'm using this in my [Markdown library](https://github.com/Zettt/km-markdown-library) so the user can search for information somewhere else while the macro is running. This has no purpose other than showing how to do it. It's a demonstration for your own inspiration.

### Mail ###

* Copy Message URL to clipboard: Copies the message URL of a selected message to the clipboard. Useful for OmniFocus. Create a task that links back to the original message.* Print iTunes Receipt: Macro to print mail as PDF. **Note**: Requires you to have [⌘P set as "Save as PDF…" in System Preferences](http://macsparky.com/blog/2008/3/19/keyboard-shortcut-for-save-as-pdf-in-os-x.html).

Feel free to send me Pull Requests with your Keyboard Maestro macros.  
*Please* put the macros in a group named "Keyboard Maestro Macros Repo" first, *before* exporting. When someone downloads/clones this repo and double-clicks a macro, they will be added to that group. This will help to keep this repo more consistent.

If there are numerous macros you want to contribute, then make a separate group, e.g. "Special Characters" in this repository.
